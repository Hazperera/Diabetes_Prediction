# Prediction of Diabetes 

### How to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset

#### Background:
Diabetes is a lifelong condition currently affecting approximately half a billion people worldwide, with an estimated increase of 51% by the year 2045 [(Saeedi et al. 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31518657/). It is primarily characterized by high level of blood glucose, which could also result in a cascade of other complications including hypertension, coronary heart diseases, stroke and other complications in kidney, feet and eyes [(Whicher et al. 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/dme.14225). Diabetes in the UK: 2019. Diabetic Medicine, 37(2), 242â€“247..

#### Dataset:
This dataset was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), originally from [UCI Machine Learning Repository .](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml)
The dataset consists of only females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
There are 8 predictor variables and 1 target variable (Outcome) as mentioned below with uniquely identified 768 observations having 268 positive for diabetes (1) and 500 negative for diabetes (0).

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
